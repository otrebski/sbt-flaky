# Detecting flaky test with sbt

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/otrebski/sbt-flaky.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/otrebski/sbt-flaky)

## Introduction
This project is proof of concept of flaky test detector SBT plugin. It can run test X times, for X minutes or until first failure.


## Installation
Example usages can be found in [demo project](https://github.com/otrebski/sbt-flaky-demo) or in [SBT scripted tests](https://github.com/otrebski/sbt-flaky/tree/master/src/sbt-test/sbt-flaky).

Add plugin to project configuration `project/plugins.sbt` or global configuration `~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/plugins.sbt`
```scala
addSbtPlugin("pl.otrebski" % "sbt-flaky" % "0.13")
```
Don't forget to enable plugin in `build.sbt`
```scala 
lazy val library = (project in file("."))
  .enablePlugins(FlakyPlugin)
```
## Versions
User version up to 0.12 for sbt 0.13. For sbt 1.0+ use plugin version 0.13.

## How to run

Run tests 30 times:
```
sbt clean "flaky times=30"
```

Run tests 30 minutes:
```
sbt clean "flaky duration=30"
```


Run tests until first failure:
```
sbt clean "flaky firstFail"
```

## Sending reports to slack
To send report to Slack, set your Slack hook id as `flakySlackHook`. Boolean property `flakySlackDetailedReport` can be set true, to enable detailed report on slack. Property `flakyHtmlReportUrl` can be set to add link to HTML reports in slack report.   
For example if your slack hook is `https://hooks.slack.com/services/AAAAAAAAA/BBBBBBBBB/CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC `, add following line to build.sbt:

```scala
flakySlackHook := Some("https://hooks.slack.com/services/AAAAAAAAA/BBBBBBBBB/CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC )
flakySlackDetailedReport := true | false
flakyHtmlReportUrl := Some("http://my-ci-server.com/jobs/project/HTML_reports/")

```

## How it works.
Command `flaky` execute `test` task multiple times. After every test iteration, test results from `./target/test-reports` is moved to `./target/flaky-test-reports/<ITERATION>`. Test task is run for X times, for X minutes or until first failing test task. All tests results are used to calculate success ratio for every test.

## Reports

sbt-flaky can create plain text report (console and `target/flaky-test-reports/report.txt` file) and report send on Slack. Failures are grouped by stacktrace and differences between messages are replace by `_`. Example of failure message `Message: expected:<00:00:00.00[_]> but was:<00:00:00.00[_]>`

Html report is saved in `/target/flaky-test-reports-html/flaky-report.html`

### Example report on console

Currently only simple test report is printed:

## History trends

Simple text and HTML report on history trends is supported.

Below is example of history report as text: 
```
[info] [info]  History trends:
[info] [info] New cases:
[info] [info] ExampleSpec.should fail sometimes Failure rate: 0.0%, 33.3%
[info] [info]
[info] [info] Improvement:
[info] [info] ExampleSpec.should fail randomly Failure rate: 50.0%, 33.3%
[info] [info]
[info] [info] No change:
[info] [info]
[info] [info]
[info] [info] Worse:
[info] [info] ExampleSpec.should fail randomly often Failure rate: 50.0%, 66.7%
[info] [info]
[info] [info]

```


History trends Html report is saved in `flaky-test-reports-html/flaky-report-history.html`

To enable history trends set `flakyHistoryDir` property in build.sbt with name of folder used to keep old reports. Currently 20 history results is kept. 
Example can be found [here](https://github.com/otrebski/sbt-flaky/blob/master/src/sbt-test/sbt-flaky/history/build.sbt)


## Backing up log files from every test run
To backup log files from every test run, specify list of files with property `flakyAdditionalFiles := List(new File("target/test.log")))` Example can be found here:

https://github.com/otrebski/sbt-flaky/blob/master/src/sbt-test/sbt-flaky/moveAdditionalFiles/build.sbt

## Reduce amount of console output
If project contains a lot of tests it can produce huge output if test is run multiple times. To reduce amount of output use `flakyLogLevelInTask` to change logger level when running flaky command.
```scala
flakyLogLevelInTask := sbt.Level.Info
or
flakyLogLevelInTask := sbt.Level.Error
```
Test classes and application can produce output to console. Consider changing log levels for tests.


## Known issues

If running a lot of tests for a many times you can get Out of memory error: `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace`. On report you will find flaky test `(It is not a test)`. Best options and good practice is to run Tests in separate JVM (fork). Details can be found in [sbt documentation](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Forking.html)

The other cause of `(It is not a test)` on report is issue https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/issues/780
